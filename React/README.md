# React.js: Getting Started

## 1. Overview
React is a framework that uses javascript and builds user interfaces. Javascript library for building uder interfaces include: ```model```, ```controller``` and ```view```. On contrary React uses only ```view```.

React has three main design concepts:
- ```Components```:
  - Like functions
  - components are reusable and can contain other components,
  - private state can be used,
- ```Reactive updates```
  - When the state of the component changes the user interface it represents changes as well,
  - React updates automatically DOM when needed,
- ```Virtual views in memory```
  - write HTML in JavaScript,
  - Tree reconciliation.

##### Virtual DOM
In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding "virtual DOM object". A virtual DOM object is lightweight. Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house.

##### React components

React components:
  - Function compontent,
  - Class Component.
