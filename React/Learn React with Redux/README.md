# 1. Getting started with React

1. Create React app globally:

  ``
npm install -g create-react-app
``
2. Create new React App:

  ``
create-react-app app-name
``
3. Start app:

  ``npm start``

Now if you run npm start in the project folder and open http://localhost:3000 in the browser.

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

We use ``React DOM`` to bind React application to an element in the HTML document. App component contains hierarchy of react components that create virtual DOM. Virtual DOM is rendered to real HTML using the React DOM library.

In React components can render other components as their children. There are two types of components: ``component class`` and ``component ``.
