# The Basics: the DOM, $ and Selectors
$ - > jQuery Collection (like an array but include additional methods)

jQuery is a function and an object.

We can pass various item to the jQuery:
$(string)
$(function)
$(DOM Element)
$.ajax()

They are called selectors.

We can use jQuery to select a part of the dom:
``
$('tag')
$('.class')
$('#id')

```javascript
all_green = $('.green');
```
