# jQuery Fundamentals

jQuery is represented by single file and work cross-browser. It allows to select things in the DOM and manipulate them and has rich event infrastructure. jQuery supports Ajax. Moreover, there are many plugins for jQuery which will make development much faster.

jQuery ``.ready()`` function can detect when a page has loaded.
Use ``$(document).ready()`` to detect when a page has loaded (DOM hierarchy but before all images have loaded) and it is ready to use.

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
  $(document).ready(function(){
    //Perform an action
  });
</script>
```
