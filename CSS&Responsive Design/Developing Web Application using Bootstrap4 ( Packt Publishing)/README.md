# 1. Getting Started

Latest Bootstrap version can be found on getboostrap.com. Boostrap4 requires ``<!DOCTYPE html>`` before <html> tag.
Three main tags need to be added at the beginning  of bootstrap in the head. These tags are used for text encoding and visualizaion on the mobile devices. The ``viewport`` is related to the fact that we should design our website first for mobile and by adding it we ensure proper rendering on mobile devices and touch zooming. Zoom functionality can be disabled by adding ``content="user-scalable=no``.

```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta http-equiv="X-UA Compatible" content="IE=edge">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width", initial-scale=1>
```

Now I will continue buidling first Boostrap example and will use CDN setup.
